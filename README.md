# CapitalOneYelpProject - Restaurant Finder

This SparkJava project uses the Yelp Api to search for currently open businesses and show their business information.
It uses the browser's geolocation to determine where to search.

The businesses are displayed to the user using solely their pictures. This removes the distraction of the ratings,
prices, and the business name and allows the user to find something that they actually want to try. Then, the user
can click on the picture to find where to go to get the food.
